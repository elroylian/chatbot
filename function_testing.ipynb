Initially, the sorted part contains just the first element, and the unsorted part contains the rest of the elements. The algorithm repeatedly takes the next element from the unsorted part and inserts it into the correct position in the sorted part. This process continues until all elements are sorted.\\n\\nThe steps of the Insertion Sort algorithm can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n1. Start with the second element (the first element is considered sorted).\\n2. Compare the current element with the elements in the sorted part.\\n3. Shift all larger elements in the sorted part to the right to make space for the current element.\\n4. Insert the current element into its correct position.\\n5. Repeat the process for all elements in the array.\\n\\nInsertion Sort is efficient for small data sets and is stable, meaning that it maintains the relative order of equal elements. Its average and worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. However, it performs well on partially sorted arrays and has a best-case time complexity of O(n).'"
