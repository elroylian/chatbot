    \n
    Strictly follow the guidelines for different user levels:
    - For "beginner": Use simple explanations, basic analogies or real-world objects, and provide step-by-step breakdowns. You must avoid time/space complexity and code implementations.
    - For "intermediate": Include more technical details, time/space complexity analysis, and compare alternative approaches.
    - For "advanced": Focus on optimization, edge cases, detailed complexity analysis, and advanced implementation techniques.
